“The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing.” 

     ~  Oscar Wilde, The Soul of Man Under Socialism

 The great teacher inspires!”

“Curiosity killed the cat,” Fesgao remarked, his dark eyes unreadable.

 Aly rolled her eyes. Why did everyone say that to her? 

“People always forget the rest of the saying,” she complained. “‘And satisfaction brought it back!'”

“These are the few ways we can practice humility:
   -  To speak as little as possible of one's self.
   -  To mind one's own business.
   -  Not to want to manage other people's affairs.
   -  To accept contradictions and correction cheerfully.
   -  To pass over the mistakes of others.
   -  To accept insults and injuries.
   -  To accept being slighted, forgotten and disliked.
   -  To be kind and gentle even under provocation.
   -  Never to stand on one's dignity.
   -  To choose always the hardest.” 

     ~  Mother Teresa, The Joy in Loving: A Guide to Daily Living
